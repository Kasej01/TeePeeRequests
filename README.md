## EzHomes
Adds homing capabilities so that you and your friends no longer have to run back to your base after a long journey.

## How To Use

```bash
# Use the below command to request to teleport to another player
/tpa playerName

# Use the below command to request another player to teleport to you
/tphere playerName

# Accepts a teleport request
/tpaccept

# Denies a teleport request
/tpdeny
```

## Custom settings
Soon we will be adding settings that users will be able to edit (specifically changing the time it takes to TP and the cost of TPing)

## Future work
